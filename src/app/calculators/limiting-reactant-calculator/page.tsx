              </h2>

              <p>
                Every reactant must first be expressed in moles.
                Divide the available moles of each reactant by
                its coefficient in the balanced equation. The
                reactant with the smaller result has the smaller
                reaction extent and limits the reaction.
              </p>

              <div className="formula-card">
                <p>
                  Reaction extent = available moles ÷
                  stoichiometric coefficient
                </p>
              </div>

              <p>
                After finding the smallest reaction extent,
                calculate the theoretical amount of product:
              </p>

              <div className="formula-card">
                <p>
                  Product moles = smallest reaction extent ×
                  product coefficient
                </p>
              </div>

              <p>
                If product mass is required, multiply the
                calculated product moles by its molar mass.

                Limiting reactant versus excess reactant
              </h2>

              <p>
                The limiting reactant is completely consumed
                first and controls the theoretical product
                yield. The excess reactant is supplied in a
                greater amount than the balanced equation
                requires and remains after the reaction.
              </p>

              <p>
                When both normalized reactant amounts are equal,
                the reactants are present in exact
                stoichiometric proportions. Neither reactant is
                left in excess under the ideal model.
