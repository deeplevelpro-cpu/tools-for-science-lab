                How to calculate percent yield
              </h2>

              <p>
                Percent yield measures the efficiency of a chemical
                reaction by comparing the product collected in an
                experiment with the maximum product predicted by
                stoichiometry.
              </p>

              <div className="formula-card">
                <p>
                  Percent yield = (actual yield ÷ theoretical
                  yield) × 100
                </p>
              </div>

              <p>
                Actual and theoretical yield must be expressed in
                the same unit. Because one value is divided by the
                other, the units cancel and the final result is
                reported as a percentage.

                Suppose a reaction has a theoretical yield of 8.4

                What does the percent yield mean?
              </h2>

              <p>
                A result close to 100% means the measured product
                amount is close to the theoretical maximum. A lower
                result indicates that some expected product was not
                recovered or formed.

              <p>
                Percent yield does not independently prove product
                purity or reaction quality. A high apparent yield
                may include solvent, moisture, unreacted material,
                or other impurities.

              <p>
                <strong>Actual yield</strong> is the amount of
                product physically recovered and measured after an
                experiment. It is determined using laboratory
                observations.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Theoretical yield</strong> is the maximum
                product amount predicted from the limiting
                reactant, balanced-equation mole ratios, and ideal
                reaction assumptions.
              </p>

              <p>
                Theoretical yield should not be estimated from the
                final experimental result. It must be calculated
                independently from the available reactants.

                Can percent yield exceed 100 percent?
              </h2>

              <p>
                The calculator permits values above 100% because
                they can occur in real laboratory records. However,
                a pure dry product cannot exceed its valid
                theoretical maximum under the assumed reaction.
              </p>

              <p>
                An apparent yield above 100% often means the sample
                contains water, residual solvent, unreacted
                material, filter paper, or another contaminant. It
                may also indicate an incorrect theoretical-yield
                calculation or an instrument error.
