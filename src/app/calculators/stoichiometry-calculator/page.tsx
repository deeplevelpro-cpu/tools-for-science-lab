                A balanced chemical equation provides a mole

                known quantity to moles, apply the coefficient
                ratio, and then convert the target moles to
                grams when a mass result is required.

                Suppose 4.032 grams of hydrogen gas are

                and the molar mass of H₂O is 18.015 g/mol.

              </h2>

              <p>
                Coefficients describe the relative number of
                molecules or moles involved in a reaction. In
                the equation 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O, two moles of
                hydrogen react with one mole of oxygen to
                produce two moles of water.
              </p>

              <p>
                Subscripts inside a chemical formula describe
                the composition of one molecule. They must not
                be used as substitutes for balanced-equation
                coefficients.
