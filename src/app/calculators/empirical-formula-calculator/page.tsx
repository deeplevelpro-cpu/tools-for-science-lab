              </h2>

              <p>
                An empirical formula describes the simplest
                whole-number ratio of the elements in a
                compound. For example, glucose has the
                molecular formula C₆H₁₂O₆, but its empirical
                formula is CH₂O because the subscripts can all
                be divided by six.
              </p>

              <p>
                The empirical formula does not always represent
                the actual number of atoms in a molecule. It
                expresses the lowest ratio supported by
                composition data.

              <p>
                Convert each element amount to moles by dividing
                it by the element atomic mass:
              </p>

              <div className="formula-card">
                <p>Moles = element amount ÷ atomic mass</p>
              </div>

              <p>
                Next, divide every mole value by the smallest
                mole value:
              </p>

              <div className="formula-card">
                <p>
                  Normalized ratio = element moles ÷ smallest
                  mole amount
                </p>
              </div>

              <p>
                If the ratios are not sufficiently close to
                whole numbers, multiply every ratio by the same
                small integer. The resulting whole numbers
                become the formula subscripts.

              <p>
                A molecular formula is a whole-number multiple
                of its empirical formula. If the empirical
                formula mass and the compound molar mass are
                known, the multiplier can be calculated:
              </p>

              <div className="formula-card">
                <p>
                  Molecular multiplier = molecular molar mass ÷

              </div>

                For example, the empirical formula CH₂O has a
                formula mass of approximately 30.026 g/mol.
                Glucose has a molar mass near 180.156 g/mol.
                The multiplier is 6, producing C₆H₁₂O₆.
