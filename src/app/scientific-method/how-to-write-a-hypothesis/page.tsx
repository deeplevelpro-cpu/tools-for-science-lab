              <p>
                A hypothesis is a testable explanation or prediction
                about the expected relationship between variables.
                It gives the experiment a clear direction and can be
                evaluated using evidence.
              </p>

              <p>
                A hypothesis should not be a random guess. It should
                be based on observations, background research,
                scientific principles, or previous evidence.
