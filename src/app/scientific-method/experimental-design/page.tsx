              </h2>

              <p>
                Experimental design is the planned structure of a
                scientific investigation. It explains what will be
                changed, what will be measured, what will remain
                constant, and how evidence will be collected.
              </p>

              <p>
                A strong design reduces bias, controls alternative
                explanations, produces usable data, and allows the
                method to be repeated.

              <p>
                Repetition helps reveal natural variation and unusual

                The number of repetitions depends on the investigation,

                precision.
