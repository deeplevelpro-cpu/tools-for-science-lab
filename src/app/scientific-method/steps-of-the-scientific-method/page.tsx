              </h2>

              <p>
                The scientific method is a structured approach to
                investigating questions using observations,
                controlled testing, measurements, analysis, and
                evidence-based conclusions.
              </p>

              <p>
                It is not simply a rigid checklist. Scientists often
                revise earlier steps, repeat trials, improve methods,
                and develop new questions as evidence becomes
                available.

              <p>
                The conclusion should state the main finding, cite

                was supported, partially supported, or not supported.

              <p>
                Scientists do not normally claim that one experiment
                proves a hypothesis. Conclusions are limited to the
                evidence and conditions tested.
