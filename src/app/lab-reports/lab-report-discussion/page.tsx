              <p>
                The discussion explains the scientific meaning of the
                results. It moves beyond reporting measurements and
                evaluates what the evidence shows about the research
                question.
              </p>

              <p>
                A strong discussion connects observed patterns to
                scientific principles, evaluates the hypothesis, and
                examines how uncertainty or limitations may have
                influenced the findings.
