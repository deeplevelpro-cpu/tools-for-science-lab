                What is a laboratory report?
              </h2>

              <p>
                A laboratory report is a structured scientific
                document that explains why an investigation was
                performed, how it was completed, what evidence was
                collected, and what conclusions can be supported by
                that evidence.
              </p>

              <p>
                A strong report should allow another reader to
                understand the investigation and, where appropriate,
                repeat the procedure. It should distinguish clearly
                between observations, calculations, interpretation,
                and scientific conclusions.
